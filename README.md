# Tiny URL

## Reason
Shortening URLs can be handy where there is a limit for the number of characters, for example: chat boxes of twitter, instagram, facebook and other platforms.

## Requirements
- Create front-end with React.
- Create back-end with Python.
- Create database with MongoDB.

- Generate a tiny URL from a long URL.
- Encode tiny URL path.
- Once a tiny URL has been entered to the address bar, redirect to the original (long) URL.
- Handle expired URLâ€™s.
- Store: tiny URL, long URL, creation date, and the user to the DB.
- Load balancer.
- Create premium users.
- Make the search function as efficient as possible to prevent latency issues.
- Premium users can view their URLs history.

## Nice to Have
- Premium users have a longer expiration time.
- Premium users can choose a path to the tiny URL by following a set of rules that match the format.
